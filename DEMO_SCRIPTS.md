# CARA - Coaching Agent

## Script Flow

### 1. INTRO (Cold Start)

**CARA:**
> Hey Alex! 👋
>
> I'm CARA, your personal coaching agent. I've been looking at your calendar and noticed something interesting — over the last month, you've had 7 meetings tagged as "vendor," "contract," or "procurement."
>
> That's a lot of negotiation happening. Some people love it, some dread it — but either way, it's a skill that compounds. Get 10% better at negotiating, and it pays dividends in every deal for the rest of your career.
>
> Want to make Negotiation your growth focus this quarter? I'll send you the right insight at the right moment — like a coach in your corner before big meetings.

**User clicks:** "Yes, let's do it!"

**User message:**
> Yes, let's do it! I could definitely use some help with negotiations.

---

### 2. AFTER YES (Setting Expectations)

**CARA:**
> Love it. Here's how this works:
>
> 📅 **Before key meetings** — I'll send you a quick technique to try, based on what's on your calendar and what you're working on.
>
> 💬 **After meetings** — Quick debrief. What worked? What didn't? I'll help you extract the lesson.
>
> 🔁 **Between meetings** — Spaced repetition. I'll quiz you on concepts so they stick when pressure hits.
>
> I'm pulling from the best sources — Chris Voss, Harvard PON, Stuart Diamond — but distilled into things you can actually use in the next 24 hours.
>
> First up: I see you have the Acme Corp renewal tomorrow. I'll reach out in the morning with something useful. Talk soon! 🤝

**User clicks:** "⏭ Next morning — Day of Acme meeting"

---

### 3. PRE-MEETING (Day of Acme Meeting)

**CARA:**
> Good morning! ☀️
>
> Acme Corp renewal is at 10 AM. Looked at your notes from last time — you mentioned they always push hard on price and last quarter you gave more ground than you wanted.
>
> I want to share a technique that's perfect for this. It's called the **Accusation Audit** — comes from Chris Voss (former FBI hostage negotiator, wrote "Never Split the Difference").
>
> The idea: Start by listing every negative thing they *might* be thinking about you. Sounds counterintuitive, right? But it works because it:
>
> 1. Takes the sting out of their objections before they raise them
> 2. Makes you look self-aware and reasonable
> 3. Often prompts them to *reassure you* instead of attack
>
> Want me to show you how to apply this to Acme specifically?

**User clicks:** "Yes, show me how"

**User message:**
> Yes, show me how to apply this to Acme.

---

### 4. ACCUSATION AUDIT (The Technique)

**CARA:**
> Here's how to open with Acme:
>
> *"Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge something. You're probably thinking we're going to give you the same runaround on pricing. You might feel like we don't fully appreciate how tight budgets are right now. And honestly, you might be wondering if this partnership is even worth renewing at these rates..."*
>
> Then — stop. Let the silence work.
>
> What usually happens: They start *disagreeing* with your negative assumptions. "No, no, we value the partnership..." And suddenly they're advocating for the deal instead of against it.
>
> **Your one move:** Write down 3 things they might be thinking negatively about you or this deal. Then say them out loud at the start.
>
> Here's a 3-minute audio refresher you can listen to on your way in. I break down exactly how to deliver it with the right tone.

**User clicks:** "Send me the audio"

**User message:**
> This is great — send me the audio, I'll listen on the way.

---

### 5. AUDIO SENT

**CARA:**
> 🎧 Here's your audio refresher — 3 minutes on the Accusation Audit with examples.
>
> One more thing: Remember, the goal isn't to "win." It's to understand what they actually need and find a path that works for both sides. Go in curious, not combative.
>
> You've got this. I'll check in after to hear how it went! 💪

**[ATTACHMENT: Audio - "Accusation Audit - Quick Refresher" - 3:12]**

**User clicks:** "⏭ After the meeting — Debrief time"

---

### 6. POST-MEETING (Debrief)

**CARA:**
> Hey! Acme meeting wrapped up — how'd it go?
>
> I'm curious:
> • Did you try the Accusation Audit?
> • How did they respond?
> • Where did you feel strong vs. where did it get tricky?
>
> No judgment — the goal is to learn. Even the "failures" are data. 📊

**User clicks:** "It went okay, but I caved at the end..."

**User message:**
> It went okay at first. I tried the Accusation Audit and they seemed disarmed. But then they threatened to walk and I panicked — ended up giving 15% more discount than I wanted.

---

### 7. BATNA EXPLANATION (Learning Moment)

**CARA:**
> Ah, the classic "walk away" moment. Don't beat yourself up — this is the #1 place people cave, even experienced negotiators.
>
> Here's what happened neurologically: When they threatened to walk, your brain triggered a loss-aversion response. The fear of losing the deal overwhelmed your rational assessment of whether the deal was even good.
>
> **The concept you need: BATNA**
> (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)
>
> Before any negotiation, you need to know: *What happens if this falls through?* Not in a vague "that would be bad" way, but specifically:
>
> • Is there another vendor?
> • What's the cost of delay?
> • What's the actual worst case?
>
> When you know your BATNA, the "walk away" threat loses its power. Because you can calmly think: "Okay, if they walk... I'll do X. That's not ideal, but it's survivable."
>
> **Your homework for next time:**
> Before any negotiation, write down in one sentence: "If this falls through, I will ___."
>
> I've saved this learning moment to your Negotiation Journal. This is actually great progress — you identified exactly where you need to grow. That's rare. Most people just feel vaguely bad and move on. 📝

**User clicks:** "⏭ 1 week later — CARA checks in"

---

### 8. SPACED REPETITION (1 Week Later)

**CARA:**
> Quick pulse check! 🎯
>
> I see you have a 1:1 with your Director at 2pm. Looking at your notes, you're planning to ask for more headcount.
>
> Pop quiz: **What's your BATNA?**
>
> If they say "no budget for new hires" — what's your Plan B?
>
> (Not a trap — I'm helping you prepare in real-time. The answer you give me now is the prep you'll wish you'd done.)

**User clicks:** "Freelancer budget — that's my Plan B"

**User message:**
> If they say no to headcount, I'll pivot to asking for freelancer budget. Same outcome, different path.

---

### 9. GOOD PIVOT (Positive Reinforcement)

**CARA:**
> Freelancer budget — that's a *great* pivot. 💡
>
> You just demonstrated what we call "creative problem-solving under constraint." Instead of:
> ❌ Accepting a flat "no"
> ❌ Getting frustrated and disengaging
> ❌ Asking for the same thing louder
>
> You found a third door. Same outcome (more capacity), different path (freelancers vs. FTEs).
>
> This is advanced negotiation. You're not just applying techniques — you're thinking flexibly.
>
> Go get it. Let me know how it lands. 🚀

**User clicks:** "⏭ 90 days later — Quarterly review"

---

### 10. QUARTERLY REVIEW (90 Days Later)

**CARA:**
> Alex — it's been 90 days. Time for your Growth Snapshot. 📊
>
> **Where You Started:**
> You came in with natural instincts but no structured framework. Your pattern was: prepare mentally, but wing it tactically. When pressure hit, you'd default to accommodation.
>
> **What You've Built:**
>
> 🟢 **Strategic Preparation (BATNA)** — Strong
> You now consistently identify alternatives before negotiations. This showed up in Week 3 when you pivoted to freelancer budget without missing a beat.
>
> 🟡 **Tactical Empathy (Accusation Audit)** — Practicing
> You've used this 3 times. Hit rate: 2/3. The miss was the Acme call where timing was off — but you self-corrected in the debrief.
>
> 🔵 **Emotional Regulation** — Emerging
> The "walk away" trigger still gets you. This is your next growth edge. We'll work on this next quarter.
>
> **Highlight Reel:**
> 🏆 Held firm on Acme pricing (first time in 3 quarters)
> 🏆 Pivoted to freelancer budget when headcount was denied
> 🏆 Completed 4 pre-meeting preps with technique application
>
> You're not the same negotiator you were 90 days ago. The data shows it, and more importantly — you can *feel* it in the room now.

**User clicks:** "This is amazing — thanks CARA!"

**User message:**
> Wow, this is amazing to see laid out like this. Thanks CARA!

---

### 11. END DEMO (Growth Snapshot PDF)

**CARA:**
> Here's your full Growth Snapshot PDF — good for sharing with your manager or just keeping for yourself.
>
> **Next quarter preview:** We're going to work on emotional regulation — staying grounded when the other side escalates. I've got some techniques from high-stakes hostage negotiation that translate beautifully to vendor calls. 😄
>
> Keep going, Alex. Real skills compound. Every negotiation from here on out benefits from what you built this quarter.
>
> See you next week. 🤝

# LENA - Learning Enablement Agent

## Script Flow

### 1. INTRO

**LENA:**
> Hey Sarah! 👋
>
> I'm LENA, your Learning Enablement Agent. I help L&D teams design, deliver, and track learning programs — without the busywork.
>
> Think of me as your learning design partner who happens to work 24/7 and never forgets to send reminders. 😄
>
> What are you working on? I can help with:
> • Building learning paths from getAbstract content
> • Scheduling and delivering to your teams
> • Tracking completion and surfacing insights
> • Nudging learners who fall behind
>
> What do you need?

**User clicks:** "I need training for 12 new managers"

**User message:**
> I need to set up training for 12 first-time managers starting Q1. They've never managed before and I want to get them up to speed on the basics — delegation, feedback, 1:1s. What can you do?

---

### 2. SETUP REQUEST (Program Design)

**LENA:**
> First-time managers — great focus. This is one of the highest-leverage training investments you can make. Research shows 60% of new managers fail in their first 2 years, usually because they never learned the basics.
>
> Here's what I'd recommend building:
>
> **📚 Learning Path: "First-Time Manager Essentials"**
>
> **Module 1: Delegation** (Week 1)
> The #1 mistake new managers make — doing everything themselves. We'll cover the what/when/how of letting go.
> → 8-min getAbstract summary + Skill Boost quiz
>
> **Module 2: Giving Feedback** (Week 1)
> Most new managers either avoid feedback or deliver it poorly. We'll teach the SBI model (Situation-Behavior-Impact).
> → 10-min summary + AI Coaching session to practice
>
> **Module 3: Running Effective 1:1s** (Week 2)
> The habit that separates good managers from great ones. We'll give them a framework they can use starting this week.
> → 8-min summary + reflection activity
>
> **The Learning Science Behind This:**
> • Spaced over 2 weeks (not crammed in one day) for better retention
> • Each module has an *action* attached — learning by doing
> • AI Coaching lets them practice tough conversations safely
>
> Total time commitment: ~45 minutes spread across 2 weeks.
>
> Want me to build this?

**User clicks:** "Yes, build it!"

**User message:**
> This looks great — yes, build it!

---

## Cross-Agent Delivery: CARA Receives Training

*After LENA launches, the training is delivered to learners via CARA. Here's what the learner (Sarah) sees in her CARA chat:*

---

### TRAINING DELIVERY (In CARA)

**CARA:**
> Hey Sarah! 🎓
>
> You've been enrolled in **"First-Time Manager Essentials"** — a learning program designed for new managers like you.
>
> Don't worry, this isn't a 4-hour workshop. It's 45 minutes total, spread across 2 weeks, with practical stuff you can use immediately.
>
> **Starting today: Module 1 — Delegation**
>
> The #1 struggle for new managers? Letting go. You got promoted because you're great at your job. Now you need to be great at helping *others* do the job. That's a different skill.
>
> This 8-minute read covers:
> • The 5 levels of delegation (not everything needs the same hand-off)
> • How to delegate without micromanaging
> • The "70% rule" — when good enough is actually better
>
> Attached is your first module. Tomorrow, I'll send you a quick activity to practice.
>
> Let's go! 💪

**[ATTACHMENT: PDF - "Module_1_Delegation.pdf" - 856 KB]**

**User clicks:** "What's the 70% rule again?"

**User message:**
> Quick question — what's the 70% rule you mentioned? I want to make sure I understand it correctly.

---

### LEARNER QUESTION (Q&A with CARA)

**CARA:**
> Great question! The 70% rule is about fighting perfectionism.
>
> Here's the idea: If someone can do a task 70% as well as you, **delegate it**. Why?
>
> 1. **They'll get better.** They might start at 70%, but with practice they'll hit 90%+.
> 2. **Your 100% isn't sustainable.** If you do everything yourself, you become the bottleneck.
> 3. **Good enough ships.** Most tasks don't need perfection — they need completion.
>
> **The mental shift:**
> Instead of asking "Can they do it as well as me?" ask "Can they do it well enough to move us forward?"
>
> **Real example:**
> You could write the team update email perfectly. But if your direct report can write it 70% as well, they should do it. They learn, you free up time, the email still gets sent.
>
> Does that help? Want me to walk through how to apply this to a specific task you're thinking about delegating?

**User clicks:** "That helps! Can we schedule the coaching?"

**User message:**
> That makes sense! Yes, I'd like to schedule the AI coaching session.

---

### COACHING SCHEDULE (Calendar Integration)

**CARA:**
> Glad that clicked! 💡
>
> Speaking of applying this — you have an **AI Coaching session** coming up as part of this program. It's a 15-minute practice session where you'll simulate delegating a task to a direct report.
>
> I'll play the direct report. You'll practice:
> • Explaining the task clearly
> • Setting expectations (the "what good looks like")
> • Checking for understanding without micromanaging
>
> **Want me to schedule it?**
>
> I can see you have some open slots:
> • Tomorrow, 2:00 PM (after your team standup)
> • Thursday, 10:00 AM
> • Friday, 11:30 AM
>
> Which works best? Or I can find another time.

**User clicks:** "Tomorrow at 2pm works"

**User message:**
> Tomorrow at 2pm works great — right after my standup.

---

### COACHING SCHEDULED (Confirmation)

**CARA:**
> Done! ✅ Booked for tomorrow at 2 PM.
>
> **What to expect:**
> • I'll send you a reminder 15 minutes before
> • The session takes about 15 minutes
> • I'll play your direct report — you practice delegating
> • No prep needed, just show up ready to practice
>
> **Pro tip:** Think of a real task you've been meaning to delegate. We'll use that as the scenario — makes the practice immediately useful.
>
> See you tomorrow! 🗓️

## Back to LENA: Progress Reports

*Sarah switches back to LENA to see progress reports...*

**User clicks:** "⏭ 2 weeks later — Progress check"

---

### 6. REPORT (2 Weeks Later)

**LENA:**
> Hey Sarah — Week 2 progress report! 📊
>
> **The Good News:**
> • **10 of 12** learners finished all modules (83%)
> • **8 of 12** completed at least one AI Coaching session
> • **Top engagement:** "Delegate one task" activity — 11/12 did it!
> • **Avg. satisfaction so far:** 4.4/5 ⭐
>
> **Needs Attention:**
> ⚠️ **Jamie Chen** — Opened Module 1 but hasn't progressed since Day 2
> ⚠️ **Priya Sharma** — Started Module 2, got stuck, hasn't returned
>
> **My Recommendation:**
> These two aren't disengaged — they're probably just busy. I can:
>
> 1. **Extend their deadline** by 1 week (gives them breathing room)
> 2. **Send a personal nudge** from you (I'll draft it, you just approve)
> 3. **Do nothing** and let the automated reminders continue
>
> What would you like me to do?

**User clicks:** "Extend their deadline by a week"

**User message:**
> Let's extend the deadline for Jamie and Priya — give them another week.

---

### 7. EXTENDED (Deadline Extended)

**LENA:**
> Done! ✅ Jamie and Priya now have until Friday.
>
> **What I'm doing:**
> • Sending a friendly "hey, you've got more time" message now
> • Scheduling a nudge for Monday (halfway reminder)
> • Scheduling final nudge for Wednesday (2 days left)
>
> **The tone:** Supportive, not guilt-trippy. Something like:
> *"Hey! Just a heads up — we've extended your deadline to Friday. Module 2 is only 10 minutes, and the feedback framework is genuinely useful. Worth finishing when you have a coffee break."*
>
> I'll let you know when they complete. 🤞

**User clicks:** "⏭ 1 week later — Program complete!"

---

### 8. FINAL REPORT (Program Complete)

**LENA:**
> Sarah — your program is complete! 🎉
>
> **Final Scorecard:**
>
> | Metric | Result |
> |--------|--------|
> | Completion Rate | **100%** (12/12) |
> | AI Coaching Sessions | **83%** (10/12) |
> | Activities Completed | **94%** avg |
> | Satisfaction Score | **4.6/5** ⭐ |
> | Avg. Time to Complete | **12 days** |
>
> **Highlights:**
> 🏆 Jamie and Priya finished after the extension — the nudges worked
> 🏆 3 learners voluntarily did extra AI Coaching sessions
> 🏆 Most-bookmarked content: "The 5 Levels of Delegation" framework
>
> **What Learners Said:**
> *"I actually used the SBI model in a real feedback conversation this week. It worked."*
> — Marcus T.
>
> *"The AI coaching was awkward at first but actually really helpful for practicing."*
> — Jamie C.
>
> **ROI Framing (for your stakeholders):**
> 12 new managers × 45 min training = 9 hours total investment
> vs. typical in-person workshop: 12 people × 4 hours = 48 hours + facilitator cost
>
> **Here's your full report PDF** — ready to share with leadership or keep for your records.
>
> Want to run this again for the next cohort? I saved it as a template. 📋
